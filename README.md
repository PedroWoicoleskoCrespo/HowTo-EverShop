## Firsts Steps

You will need an account on a hosting service, and you will be required to put in your credit card info, although some providers wont charge anything by default because they have a free tier, or free plan if you prefer.

### Recommended Hosting Services (With **Free Tier**/**Free Trial**)

-   [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
-   [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

### "I dont want to use a hosting service"

If you dont want to use a hosting provider, you will be required to use something else in its place, wich is usually a lot harder to do, since it may very well end up being way more pricey. (Wich will not be covered in this guide)
